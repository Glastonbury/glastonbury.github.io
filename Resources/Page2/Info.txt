Glastonbury is attended by around 200,000 people each year, reaching a record of 300,000 in 1994. Most of the festival staff are volunteers who help the festival raise millions of pounds for charity. This festival is regarded as a major event in British culture, it is inspired by the "hippie" counterculture of the 1960s.
The festival is hosted every year, with the exception of "fallow" years which happen around every 5 years to give the land and local population a rest. The festival is located at 28 Northload Street, Glastonbury BA6 9JJ.
